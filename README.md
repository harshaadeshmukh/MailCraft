## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why It Was Used |
|---|---|---|
| 🖥️ **Backend** | Java 21 + Spring Boot | Spring Boot is the gold standard for building production-grade REST APIs in Java. It offers auto-configuration, embedded server, and a massive ecosystem — perfect for quickly scaffolding a robust backend. |
| 🤖 **AI Engine** | Google Gemini API | Gemini provides state-of-the-art language understanding and generation capabilities. It's free-tier friendly, fast, and produces high-quality text — ideal for generating natural-sounding email replies. |
| 🐳 **Containerization** | Docker | Docker ensures the app runs identically across all environments (local, staging, production). The Dockerfile packages the Spring Boot JAR into a portable image, eliminating "works on my machine" problems. |
| ☁️ **Deployment** | Render | Render supports Docker-based deployments out of the box and offers a free tier for hobby projects. The `render.yaml` file enables Infrastructure-as-Code style deployments for easy CI/CD. |
